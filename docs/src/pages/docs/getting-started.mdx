## Installation

To install llm-functions, you can use npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install llm-functions
```

or

```shell
yarn add llm-functions
```

## LLM Function


You can run the following examples in [llm-function example](https://codesandbox.io/s/llm-functions-examples-0ck6c6) sandbox

An LLM Function is composed of a few parts. Each part gives you additional functionality and more control over your output.
To start, let's create a very simple function

```typescript
import { llmFunction } from "llm-functions";
const simpleFunction = llmFunction
  .name("A function that does nothing")
  .create();
```

We created the simplest function there can be. The function signature is `() => Promise<string>`
Let's call it to see what happens.

```typescript
import { llmFunction } from "llm-functions";
const functionResult = await simpleFunction();
console.log(functionResult);
// "There is no prompt provided. Please provide a prompt for me to generate output."
```

That's pretty useless. Let's add a prompt by using the `instructions` method.

```typescript {3}
const bandNameGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Band name generator")
  .instructions("Generate band names")
  .create();
```

This tells GPT that we want it to generate band names.
Let's call this function and see what happens!

```typescript
const bandNames = await bandNameGenerator();
```

We get a string

```
1. Electric Stardust
2. Midnight Mirage
3. Cosmic Echoes
4. Neon Serenade
5. Velvet Thunder
6. Solar Symphony
7. Lunar Lullaby
8. Radiant Rhapsody
9. Sonic Oasis
10. Dreamy Daze
```

That's pretty good! However, the result is a string. We want an array of strings so we can use it in our app.
To do that, we can force GPT to output in a specific format using zod and the `output` method.

```typescript {4}
const bandNameGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Band name generator")
  .instructions("Generate band names")
  .output(z.array(z.string())
  .create();
```

The function signature is `() => Promise<string[]>`. Let's call this function and see what happens!
We get

```typescript
[
  "Electric Dreams",
  "Neon Nights",
  "Cosmic Echoes",
  "Galactic Groove",
  "Starlight Serenade",
];
```

Much better! We can now map over the array and render it in a UI however we like.

Now, let's try something more complicated. Let's add a genre name to each of these band names.

```typescript {8}
const bandNameGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Band name generator")
  .instructions("Generate some fake band names for my new band")
  .output(
    z.array(
      z.object({
        bandName: z.string(),
        genre: z.string(),
      })
    )
  .create();
```

We get

```typescript
[
  {
    bandName: "Electric Dreams",
    genre: "Indie Rock",
  },
  {
    bandName: "Neon Nights",
    genre: "Synthpop",
  },
  {
    bandName: "The Midnight Riders",
    genre: "Country",
  },
];
```

We can also try this function out in the tracing UI!
![image](/images/band-with-genre.png)

Now let's say we only want to generate band names in `rock` `pop` and `rap` category. We can make the genre into an enum and restrict it to those genres.
At the same time, we'll also tell GPT to generate the band names in spanish.
To do that, we can add furthur directions in the `instructions` field - but there is a better way! We can use zod's `decsribe` function to force GPT to give us spanish band names for the key `bandName`.
This gives you granualr control over each key without having to write complicated prompts.
While we're at it, let's also add an album names field.

You can write prompt at the key level!

```typescript {7-10}
const bandNameGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Band name generator")
  .instructions("Generate some fake band names for my new band")
  .output(
    z.array(
      z.object({
        // You can write prompt for each key!
        bandName: z.string().describe('Band names are in Spanish'),
        genre: z.enum(["rock", "pop", "rap"]),
        albums: z.array(z.string()).describe('Their top charting albums. Titles could be in English or Spanish'),
      })
    )
  .create();
```

The type of the function is automatically inferred from the zod schema passed to the output method:

```typescript
() =>
  Promise<
    {
      bandName: string;
      genre: "pop" | "rock" | "rap";
      albumName: string[];
    }[]
  >;
```

Let's run this function and see what happens!
![image](/images/with-album-names.png)

It did all three things!

1. `bandName` is in spanish
2. `genre` is restricted to `rock`, `pop` and `rap`
3. `albumNames` is an array of strings


What if we wanted the function to take a genre as an input and return results in that genre? This would allow you to take a user input and pass it to the function!
To do this, we can define and interpolate a variable in our instructions.

```typescript /${genre}/
const bandNameGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Band name generator")
  .instructions("Generate some fake band names for my new band ${genre}")
  .output(
    z.array(
      z.object({
        bandName: z.string(),
        genre: z.enum(["rock", "pop", "rap"]),
        albums: z.array(z.string()).describe('Their top charting albums. Titles could be in English or Spanish'),
      })
    )
  .create();
```

The function now takes genre as an input. The type of the input is inferred from the interpolated variable in the instructions.
Let's run this function and see what happens!

```typescript
const bandNames = bandNamesGenerator({ instructions: { genre: "rock" } });
```
You can also run this function in the tracing UI. An input field was auotmatically created based on the variable
![image](/images/with-input.png)

It's typesafe all the way down! You will get an error if you try to call the function without the variable `genre`!
