## Installation

To install llm-functions-ts, you can use npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install llm-functions-ts
```

or

```shell
yarn add llm-functions-ts
```

## Defining an LLM Function

Let's create a quick LLM function that will allow us to generate a list of countries that start with a given letter.
We want this function to take a letter as input and return a list of countries that start with that letter.

```typescript
import { createAiFunction } from "llm-functions-ts";
const generateCountryNames = createAIFn()
  .name("A function that generates country names")
  .instructions("Generate countries names that start with the letter {letter}.")
  .output(z.object({ countryNames: z.array(z.string()) }))
  .create();
```

The `generateCountryNames` has the following type signature

```typescript
const generateCountryNames: (args: {
  instructions: {
    letter: string;
  };
}) => Promise<{
  countryNames: string[];
}>;
```

Notice that the function takes a variable named letter. This variable is automatically inferred from the {} instructions. 
WHen the function is executed, the instruction will be interpolated with this variable.
The output of the functon is inferred from the zod schema passed to the output method of our LLM function.

Let's use this function!
```typescript
const result = await generateCountryNames({ instructions: { letter: "A" } });
// result.countryNames = ["Afghanistan", "Albania", "Algeria", "Andorra", "Angola", "Antigua and Barbuda", "Argentina", "Armenia", "Australia", "Austria", "Azerbaijan"]
```
Since this is just a typescript function that outputs a structured data, we can use it anywhere we want.

## Trace UI
The function above automatically generates a playground UI that allows you to test the function.

The UI can be used as a playground to test your functions.
