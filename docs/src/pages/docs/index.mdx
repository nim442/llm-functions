## Introduction

**llm-functions-ts** is a declarative TypeScript library designed to seamlessly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into existing software stacks.
Just declare your function and llm-functions-ts takes care of the rest.

```typescript
import { llmFunction } from "llm-functions-ts";
import * as z from "zod";

const const generateCountryNames = llmFunction
  .instructions("Generate countries names that start with {letter}")
  .output(z.object({ countryNames: z.array(z.string()) }))
  .create();

// (args: { instructions: {letter: string} }) => Promise<{ countryNames: string[] }>
const result = await generateCountryNames({ instructions: { letter: "A" } });
// result.countryNames = ["Afghanistan", "Albania", "Algeria", "Andorra", "Angola", "Antigua and Barbuda", "Argentina", "Armenia", "Australia", "Austria", "Azerbaijan"]
```

The generated functions are just **strongly typed** typescript functions, you can use them anywhere in your existing typescript projects as you would a normal function.
A Playground UI is automatically generated that allows you to test this function.

## Motivation

There are a other libraries that help developers write LLM chains.
However, they are often a these shortcomings with them:
- Too much boilerplate
- Not typesafe
- Verbose and require some setup
- Build in python so it's hard to integrate with existing typescript projects.

The goal of llm-functions-ts is to provide sane defaults that make it extremely easy to integrate LLM's in your existting typescript projects.
We take typesafety very seriously. For example, changing a variable in the prompt results in a typescript error.

Another challenge is that testing LLM chains is hard. **llm-functions-ts** comes with a UI that allows you to trace, evaluate and debug your functions.
The UI is automatically generated so all you have to worry about is writing your function and a UI is autogenerated for each function. Think [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for LLM's.

## Features

- **Fully typesafe**: Outputs a fully typesafe function that can be used anywhere in your typescript projects.

- **Structured Data Output**: Using zod, you can specify any schema for an output. Built in validation and smart retries.

- **Batteries included**: Comes with a tracing UI, automatic document chunking, structured output, and more. Just define your function and llm-functions-ts takes care of the rest.

- **Automatic Chunking of Large Documents**: llm-functions will automatically optimize your documents for qurying.

- **UI for Traces and Debugging**: llm-functions-ts comes with a UI that allows you to trace and debug your functions.
