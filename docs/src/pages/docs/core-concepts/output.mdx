# Output
Output method allows you to define the expected structure of the data returned by your LLM function.

## Usage

To define the output schema, you can pass a zod schema as an argument to the output function. [Zod](https://zod.dev/) is a schema validation library that provides a convenient way to define and validate data schemas. 



```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { createAiFunction } from "llm-functions";

const outputSchema = z.object({
  countryNames: z.array(z.string()),
});

// Pass the output schema to the output function
const generateCountryNames = createAiFunction
  .output(outputSchema)
  .create()
```


Here's the generated type signature of your LLM function
```typescript {countryNames/}
() => Promise<{
  countryNames: string[];
}>;
```
This allows you to query an LLM and return a data structure that conforms to the types already defined in your existing codebase.

## Validation of Response with Zod Schema

**llm-functions** ensures that the response from the LLM function adheres to the specified output schema. When a response is received, it is validated against the output schema using the Zod library. If the response fails the validation, indicating that it doesn't match the expected structure, llm-functions will loop back the response and the validation error to the LLM to obtain a new response that conforms to the defined schema.
