## Scraping website
Simply pass `{type: 'url'}` to the `documents` functions. 

```typescript
const adGenerator = llmFunction
  .name("Summarize site")
  .document({ type: "url" })
  .instructions(`Create an ad for this website. THe target demographic is pirates`)
  .output(
    z.array(
      z.object({
        adCopy: z.string(),
      })
    )
  )
  .create();
```

The result
```typescript
const ad = adGenerator({
  documents: ["https://www.pirates.com"],
});

console.log(ad);
// {
//  adCopy :"Ahoy there, mateys! Are ye ready to plan the swashbuckling event of the year?
