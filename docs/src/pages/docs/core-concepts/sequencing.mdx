# Sequencing functions

Sequencing is essential to unlock the full potential of the LLMS.
By sequencing multiple functions, you can create complex and powerful flows.
Since the AI functions are simply just javascript functions, you can just compose them by calling them one after another.
However, a `sequenee` function is provided. The main advantage of using the sequence function is that it will be registered as one function in the Trace UI.
This allows you to run the full flow of the sequence in the Trace UI.
